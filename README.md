# Bayesian TRPO

This repository hosts the code for my Advanced Machine Learning (STA571) project at Duke. You can see a brief overview by viewing the [poster](presentation/poster.pdf).

The idea is pretty simple: to find good step sizes for a reinforcement learning algorithm, use [Bayesian hyperparameter optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.2944.pdf) on [TRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05477).
